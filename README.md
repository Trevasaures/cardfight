# Cardfight!! Deck Battle Simulator 🎴

A fun little side project to randomly generate matchups between some of my Vanguard decks.
If you decide to use this repo for yurself for giggles, feel free to edit your own decks in the `decks.py` file!

The project is growing into a full app with:

- 🎲 Random deck matchups (Standard, Stride, or Mixed)
- 🏆 Match history logging (with notes)
- 📊 Deck stats (wins/losses, win %)
- 🖥️ Flask API backend with SQLite persistence
- 🌐 GUI/Frontend (future Streamlit or Flask templates)
